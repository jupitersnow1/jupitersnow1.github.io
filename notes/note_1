Creating the "Skeleton" of the Website
August 4, 2025
by Jacqueline Sanchez

Today, I’m focusing on building the structure of the landing page — the foundation that will guide the rest of the design. My goal is to map out the layout of the content across the page before diving into visual styling like colors and fonts.

I'm also keeping responsive design top of mind. That means considering how the site will appear across various screen sizes: PCs, mobile devices, and larger desktop displays. The structure needs to adapt smoothly to ensure a consistent and intuitive experience regardless of the platform.

The landing page will consist of the following sections: 

* Hero section with a short intro and CTA (Call to Action)

* About Me

* Projects

* Contact

* Footer
